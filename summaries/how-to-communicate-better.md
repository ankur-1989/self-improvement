## 10 Tips to have better conversation

1. Be present there.
2. Don't ponitificate - just don't start with your personal opinion or biased listening. Everybody you meet has something that you dont know.
3. Ask open ended questions. who, where, what etc?
4. Go with the flow
5. if you dont know say that you don't know
6. Don't equate your experience with theirs. if somebody is talking about that he has lost his family member - don't start with yours.
7. Try not to repeat yourself.
8. Stay out of weeds. people don't care about details like names , dates etc.
9. Listen. Stephen covey: Most of the people don't listen with the intent to understand but with the intent to reply.
10. Be Brief - Amused line: A good conversation is like a mini skirt: short enough to retain the interest and long enough to cover the subject.
